# 🎲 Dice Rolling Project in Python

## 📜 Project Description
In this project, you will create a **virtual dice roller** using Python. A dice is a cube with six faces, each showing a number from 1 to 6. When you roll a dice, a random number between 1 and 6 is displayed.

Your task is to simulate this dice-rolling behavior in Python! 🐍

## 🔍 What You Will Learn
- **How to generate random numbers** using Python's `random` library.
- **Basic programming concepts**, such as printing output and user interaction.
- **How to simulate real-world objects** like dice in a program.

## 🧰 Tools and Concepts
1. **Python Programming Language**  
   Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/).

2. **The `random` Library**  
   The `random` library allows you to generate random numbers. This is essential for simulating a dice roll, where the outcome should be unpredictable.

## 💡 Tips for Beginners
1. **Understand the Problem**  
   Think about what happens when you roll a dice in real life. How would you represent that in code?

2. **Learn About `random.randint()`**  
   Research how the `random.randint(a, b)` function works. It generates a random integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive.

3. **Test as You Go**  
   Don't try to complete the whole project in one go. Break it into smaller steps:
   - First, figure out how to generate a random number.
   - Then, display that number as the result of the dice roll.

4. **Add Your Personal Touch**  
   Can you make your dice roller more interactive? For example, ask the user if they want to roll again.

5. **Google is Your Friend**  
   If you’re stuck, search for how others approach similar problems. Understanding examples can help!

## 🚀 Challenge Extension (Optional)
- Simulate rolling **two dice** and display the total.
- Add custom faces to your dice, like emojis or words instead of numbers.
- Use a loop to let the user roll the dice multiple times until they decide to stop.


Good luck, and have fun coding! 🎉
